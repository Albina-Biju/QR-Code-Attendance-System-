I developed a QR Code Attendance System to streamline and automate the process of marking attendance in educational or organizational settings. The system generates unique QR codes for  user and leverages a real-time scanning interface to capture attendance with precise timestamps. Built using technologies such as Python, Html, CSS,Databases, Django and a user-friendly interface the system eliminates manual entry errors and significantly reduces processing time. It supports features like duplicate scan prevention,  and admin access to view or filter attendance records. This project improves accuracy, enhances security, and offers a scalable solution for efficient attendance management.
